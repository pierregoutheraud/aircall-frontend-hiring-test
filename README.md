# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

### Styling

I am using a mix between style props, elements from Traktor and my own custom css.
I am aware that this is not very elegant and we should focus on one of those 2 solutions, but
I felt more comfortable writing a mix, knowing the limited time I had to work on the project.
